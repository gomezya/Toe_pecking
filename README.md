# Toe_pecking
Comparison of different diets on toe health of laying hens

The Rcode: bird_tracking.R refers to getting the movement data of specific hens for specific time windows. The goal would be to find certain hens with toe pecking in video observations, to be able to link HenID of movement data with the birds on the video. 

The Ubelix code is to extract movement data for Toe pecking project of the last 4 weeks before legrings were removed in Pens 13 to 16.
All birds were examined about toe pecking severity score (0, 1, x and 2) with 0 = no toe injuries, 1 injuries (above score 1, below 3) ad 2 severe toe injuries above 8 and everything in between as score x.
Data to be extracted: vertical travel distance, durations per zones, wintergarden usage, medium timepoint nestbox usage and corresponding latencies.
